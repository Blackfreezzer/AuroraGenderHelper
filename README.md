===========================

## What is it about?

Getting less points for DWI just because you missed gendering a word sucks. This script hopefully helps with that.

### A brief description of the script and its possibilities

The Script checks the textfield against almost 700 non-gendered words and notifys you if it finds one. It´s far from perfect and will have false positives,.... Use at own risk ;)

## Requirements

* Google Chrome with [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo "Tampermonkey"), or
* Firefox with [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/greasemonkey "Greasemonkey")


## Usage

1. Download the UserScript and install it to Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey.
1. Enable the script.
1. Go into the challenge.
1. Profit


## Changelog

Can be found within the script.
